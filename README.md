# F# + MonoGame

The new structre of the monogame templatea allows us to easily start using F# as the core Library for any monogame project

This template is taken from `dotnet new mgblank2dstartkit` it just switches the `Core` project for F# instead of C# Feel free to rename "Pomo" to your actual project name.
